# Template Service

This folder is a lightweight placeholder that should be copied from `platform-libraries/service-starter` when starting a new service.

How to use

1. Copy the `platform-libraries/service-starter` contents into `services/<your-service-name>`.
2. Update `pom.xml` groupId/artifactId and `application.yml` service name.
3. Implement domain code and OpenAPI contract.
