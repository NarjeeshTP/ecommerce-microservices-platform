# ADR 0004 — Authentication & Authorization

Status: Proposed

Context

Services must authenticate requests and enforce authorization rules.

Decision

Use OAuth2 / OIDC with JWTs. Keycloak will be the reference identity provider for local/dev; production can use a managed IdP with compatible tokens.

Consequences

- Services will validate JWTs and enforce scopes/roles as needed.
- A local Keycloak instance will be provided in `infra/` for development convenience.
