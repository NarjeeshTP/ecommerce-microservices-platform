# ADR 0007 — CI/CD Strategy

Status: Proposed

Context

We need a repeatable build and deployment pipeline for many services.

Decision

Use GitHub Actions as the primary CI runner and Helm + GitHub Actions for deployments to staging. Images will be published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

Consequences

- Workflows will be scoped per-service using path filters.
- CI will include unit tests, integration tests (Testcontainers) where feasible, and image builds.
